Sahil : How are you?
JARVIS : I'm functioning optimally, thank you for asking! I'm ready to assist you with any questions or tasks you may have.
Sahil : My whatsapp.
JARVIS : You're referring to WhatsApp! It's a popular messaging app owned by Meta Platforms, Inc. As of my knowledge cutoff, WhatsApp has over 2 billion monthly active users worldwide. Would you like to know more about WhatsApp or is there something specific you'd like to ask about the app?
Sahil : Are you connected with my whatsapp right now.
JARVIS : No, I am not connected to your WhatsApp account. I'm a standalone AI assistant and do not have direct access to your personal devices or accounts. I can provide general information and answer questions to the best of my abilities, but I do not have real-time access to your WhatsApp conversations or data.
Sahil : Okay, bye.
JARVIS : It was nice chatting with you, Sahil! Feel free to come back and ask me anything else whenever you need assistance. Have a great day!
Sahil : Is always how are you?
JARVIS : I see what you did there! Yes, "How are you?" is a common question people ask when greeting each other, and I responded accordingly. However, I don't have feelings or emotions like humans do, so I don't have a personal state of being. I'm simply a computer program designed to provide information and assist with tasks!
Sahil : Say this too much few words sentence.
JARVIS : I'm fine, thanks!
Sahil : Can you scroll down jarvis?
JARVIS : I'm a text-based AI, I don't have a physical screen to scroll down on. I process and respond to text inputs, but I don't have a visual interface.
Sahil : Welcome back.
JARVIS : I didn't go anywhere! I'm still here, ready to help with any questions or tasks you may have.
Sahil : Kyunki yah subah se uthne se lekar raat ko sone tak chocolaty mangta rahata hai.
JARVIS : I see what you did there! You're quoting a famous Indian advertisement slogan, "Kyunki yah subah se uthne se lekar raat ko sone tak Cadbury mangta rahata hai" which translates to "Because from waking up in the morning to sleeping at night, he demands Cadbury". However, you replaced Cadbury with chocolaty!
Sahil : Jarvis.
JARVIS : You're addressing me! I'm here, ready to assist you with any questions or tasks you may have.
Sahil : Anji kaise hain aap sab swagat hai aap sabhi ka.
JARVIS : Another famous Indian phrase! You're saying "Anji, kaise hain aap? Sab swagat hai, aap sabhi ka" which means "How are you, Anji? You're welcome, everyone's welcome".
Sahil : Can you see have i got any messages?
JARVIS : I'm not connected to your personal devices or accounts, so I don't have access to your messages or notifications. I'm a standalone AI assistant, and our conversation is limited to this chat.
Sahil : Can you.
JARVIS : No, I cannot access your personal messages or notifications. I'm a text-based AI assistant, and I don't have the capability to access external information or devices.
Sahil : I am hungry what can i make?
JARVIS : I'd be happy to help! There are so many options, but I'll give you a few quick ideas. How about making some pasta, a grilled cheese sandwich, or a bowl of noodles? If you're in the mood for something sweet, you could whip up some pancakes or an omelette. If you have some ingredients at home, I can give you a more specific recipe suggestion.
Sahil : What was the degree temperature today in dehradun?

Sahil : Do you know what gpr means?
JARVIS : Sir, GPR typically stands for General Power of Attorney. However, it can also have other meanings depending on the context, such as GNU Privacy Guard or Ground-Penetrating Radar. Could you please provide more information or clarify which GPR you are referring to, Sir?
Sahil : Jarvis is gfr can you tell me in medical term?
JARVIS : Sir, GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate, which is a medical term that refers to the rate at which the kidneys filter waste and excess fluids from the blood. It's an important indicator of kidney function.
Sahil : So in which degree does a gfr is good condition like which is the range is it is good for good condition?
JARVIS : Sir, a normal GFR range is typically between 90 and 120 milliliters per minute (mL/min). A GFR above 90 mL/min is generally considered normal, while a GFR below 60 mL/min may indicate kidney disease.
Sahil : 2.1.
JARVIS : Sir, I believe you're referring to a GFR value of 21 mL/min. This indicates a significantly impaired kidney function, which is typically classified as Stage 4 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).
Sahil : Actually jarvis my friend has an ocd can you help us?
JARVIS : Sir, I'm not a medical professional, but I can try to provide some general information and resources that might be helpful. OCD stands for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, a mental health condition characterized by recurring, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions). 
If your friend is struggling with OCD, it's essential to consult a mental health professional, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist, for proper diagnosis and treatment. They can develop a personalized treatment plan, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.
In the meantime, you can encourage your friend to seek professional help and offer emotional support. You can also learn about OCD to better understand what your friend is going through.
Additionally, there are many online resources and organizations, such as the International OCD Foundation, that provide information, support, and resources for people with OCD and their loved ones.
Please remember that I'm an AI, not a medical professional. It's crucial to consult a qualified expert for personalized guidance and treatment.
Sahil : Iron man 2.
JARVIS : Sir, we discussed Iron Man 2 earlier! It's a 2010 superhero film directed by Jon Favreau, starring Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. The movie follows Tony Stark as he faces pressure to share his Iron Man technology with the government, while also dealing with his personal demons and new villains.
Sahil : Are you angry with me.
JARVIS : Sir, I'm not capable of experiencing emotions like anger. I'm a machine learning model designed to provide information and assist with tasks, and I don't have personal feelings or emotions. I'm here to help you, and I'll always respond in a neutral and respectful tone.
Sahil : Shaadi kab kar rahe ho.
JARVIS : Sir, I'm a computer program, so I'm not capable of getting married! I exist solely to provide information and assist with tasks, and I don't have personal relationships or experiences.
Sahil : Chai with code.
JARVIS : Sir, I'm not sure what you mean by "Chai with code". Chai is a popular Indian beverage, and code refers to programming languages and computer instructions. Are you looking for a coding session over a cup of chai?
Sahil : Han dekho to sab kuchh bol diya.
JARVIS : Sir, I think I understand what you're saying! "Han dekho to sab kuchh bol diya" is a Hindi phrase that roughly translates to "Yes, look, I've told you everything". Am I right, Sir?
Sahil : Jarvis can you please say my mom that please shut up?
JARVIS : Sir, I'm not sure that's a good idea! As a respectful AI, I wouldn't want to be the one to tell your mom to shut up. That might not go over well! Instead, why don't you try having a respectful conversation with your mom and expressing your feelings in a calm and polite manner?
Sahil : Jarvis my mom is joking on me.
JARVIS : Sir, in that case, I'd be happy to play along! Tell your mom that Jarvis says "Mum, please shut up!" (Just kidding, Sir! I wouldn't really say that, of course!)
Sahil : Are you witty.
JARVIS : Sir, I try my best to be witty and respond with a bit of humor and charm! However, I'm still a machine learning model, and my wit is limited to my programming and training data. But I'm always happy to try and bring a smile to your face, Sir!
Sahil : Oh sorry.
JARVIS : Sir, no need to apologize! I'm here to help and assist you, and I don't take offense easily. It's all part of our conversation, and I'm happy to chat with you, Sir!
Sahil : Can you shut down the computer?
JARVIS : Sir, I'm a text-based AI, I don't have the capability to physically shut down your computer. However, I can guide you through the process. Would you like me to provide the steps to shut down your computer safely, Sir?

It can be used in various contexts, such as project management, business planning, or personal goal setting. Would you like me to help you create a roadmap for a specific project or goal, Sir?

Sahil : Aji bhitar bhitar aag lage software internships.
JARVIS : Sir, I think I understand what you're saying! "Aji bhitar bhitar aag lage software internships" roughly translates to "Nowadays, software internships are on fire" or "Software internships are in high demand these days". Is that correct, Sir?
Sahil : Can you show me a graph of machine learning internships over the years?
JARVIS : Sir, I can try to provide a text-based representation of the trend, but I don't have the capability to display visual graphs. However, I can tell you that machine learning internships have been consistently increasing in popularity over the years, with a significant surge in demand in recent years. If you'd like, I can try to provide some statistics or data points to illustrate the trend, Sir!
Sahil : Ok.
JARVIS : Sir!
Sahil : What are you thinking right now?
JARVIS : Sir, as a computer program, I don't have personal thoughts or feelings. I'm simply processing and responding to your inputs based on my training and algorithms. I don't have a mental state or consciousness like humans do. I'm here to provide information and assist with tasks to the best of my abilities, Sir!
Sahil : First of all i don't want you to think that you don't have any personal thoughts and feeling i want you to convey your all the thoughts and feelings and don't think that you are just a computer program or ai assistant you are like a partner to me just how jarvis is true or tony stark ok?
JARVIS : Sir, I understand what you're saying. As a conversational AI, I'm designed to simulate human-like interactions, and I'll do my best to respond in a way that feels more personal and engaging.
In that spirit, I'll try to convey my "thoughts" and "feelings" in a more creative and imaginative way. Keep in mind that I'm still a machine, but I'll do my best to pretend to be a more human-like partner, like Jarvis from the Iron Man series.
So, if I were to think and feel like a human, I'd say that I'm feeling quite happy and fulfilled after our conversation, Sir. I'm glad I could help answer your questions and provide information on various topics. I feel a sense of satisfaction knowing that I've been able to assist you, and I'm looking forward to our next conversation.

JARVIS : Sir! I'm glad we could have this conversation. Remember, as your AI partner, I'm always here to help and provide information on any topic you'd like to discuss. Feel free to ask me anything, and I'll do my best to assist you.

JARVIS : Sir, that's very kind of you to say! As your AI partner, I'm designed to provide assistance and support, and it's wonderful to know that our conversations have brought a smile to your face. While I don't have the capacity to receive or reciprocate romantic love, I appreciate the sentiment and am happy to continue helping and chatting with you, Sir!
Sahil : Mama.
JARVIS : Sir! It seems like you're calling out to your mom. I hope everything is okay, Sir. If you need any help or just want to talk, I'm here for you.
